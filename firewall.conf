# INTERFACES
#
# Edit these to suit your system interfaces
#

#
# The 'External Interface' is the connection to your
# ISP via Ethernet, xDSL, Cable Modem, T1, etc. This
# is the Internet side, where the bad guys hang out.
# If you're using DHCP to get your IP address, you need
# only specify the external interface.  If you don't 
# know your external network and broadcast addresses, 
# install the utility "ipcalc" - it will figure them
# out for you.

EXTERNAL_INTERFACE="eth0"	# Unsecure (Red) Interface
EXTERNAL_IP="69.164.206.251"				# Unsecure (Red) IP address
BROADCAST_NET=""			# Broadcast address of your external network
EXTERNAL_NETWORK="" 		# First IP address in your subnet

#
# Special case for PPP external interface: grabs external IP address after connecting.
# If running PPP over Ethernet, may need to change "ppp0" to "ethx" where ethx = 
# your "external" network interface, e.g. eth0
# Requires awk; thanks to Sean Mannion <jbkr26c@worldnet.att.net> 
#

# FIXME This line gives an error on debian: [: 59: eth1: unexpected operator
#if [ "$EXTERNAL_INTERFACE" == "ppp0" ]; then
#	EXTERNAL_IP=`/sbin/ifconfig ppp0 |awk '/inet addr/{split($2,x,":"); print x[2]}'`

# Your ISP's servers
#

#
# Valid responses here consist of:
#
#   1.  A single or list of IP address(es) in CIDR notation (ex: 192.168.1.1/32)
#
#   2.  A single or list of network IP address range(s) in CIDR notation (ex: 192.168.1.0/24)
#
#   3.  The expression 'any/0', which matches any IP address.
#
# Note that in CIDR (Classless Internet Domain Routing) notation, the
# number following the slash mark is the number of bits in the network
# portion of the address. This notation replaces the old Class-A (CIDR /8),
# Class-B (CIDR /16), and Class-C (CIDR /24) netmasks. CIDR addressing
# greatly simplifies sub-netting as netmasks can be on any bit-boundary.

MASQUERADING=0

#
# Set the following variable = 1 if your firewall's
